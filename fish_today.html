<p>Fish Today is a prototype website and app designed for a school project from my user experience course. This was a group project focused around developing a concept for a digital product, whether this be for a desktop, mobile, or tablet platform. The goal of this project was being able to take an idea, conduct research and user testing, and eventually create an interactive prototype.</p>
<p>When we were presented with this project we were initially given the concept of sports, and had the freedom to create a prototype around this idea. After some brainstorming we realized that most sports already had their own individual websites, however, fishing wasn't heavily focused on. There were very few websites and mobile applications regarding fishing. With this in mind, we decided to create a website solely around fishing that would allow a user to obtain all necessary information about fishing all within one application. This is when we came up with the idea of Fish Today.</p>
<p>Fish Today is our solution to the lack of support for the fishing community. It allows users to easily find the best locations near them, find fishing buddies, purchase the latest fishing gear, as well as planning for an up and coming fishing trip. It gives the user all this information into one convenient package on either our website or mobile application.</p>
<p>While designing this prototype, we found that user testing had a significant impact on the way our website looked as well as features that were included in it. User testing allowed us to obtain feedback from actual fishermen giving us the ability to narrow down our demographic, remove certain features the weren't necessary for our product, and improve upon current features making them more user friendly for all to use.</p>
