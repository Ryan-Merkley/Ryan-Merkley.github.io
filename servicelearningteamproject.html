		  <p>This project was a team assignment for my arts and business course. The objective of this project was to create a new product, design that product, and successfully market it. Our group decided to team up with the arts student union at our school to market our product. The reason we chose them is because we saw that they had more potential in reaching out to more students and didn't currently have arts related apparel to be purchased. Our objective was to design a T-shirt to fulfill the gap of students wanting to purchase arts related clothing. We began this project by promoting the arts student union through multiple events around our school. These events allowed us to obtain more support for ASU from various faculties. We then designed T-shirt logos and submitted them off to the ASU council to determine the best designs. Upon receiving the results, we then ordered all the necessary shirts and began marketing them through flyers and social media. We had a day focused on selling our merchandise and it turned out to be a success as by the end of the day we had sold out all our T-shirts.</p>
		  <p>I was responsible for the promotional elements for both the T-shirts and the Arts Student Union. I began promoting events through the ASU Facebook page. I created calendar events and posted photos from previous events to inform all students of the event. I attended each event in person so that I could promote the union with various students. Once these events were complete, I decided to create a survey to obtain feedback from those who attended. I learned that many students found the events boring and not informative, so I initiated an incentive program where if students liked the ASU Facebook page and attended the event they would earn a prize. These promotional efforts were helpful as it increased attendance for our final sales event.</p>
		  <p>I believe that I was able to use my communication skills to successful advertise our T-shirts. I communicated with the ASU council through emails to discuss and approve our event plans. I confidently presented my teams ideas showing potential designs and promotional samples. During the events, I interacted with students in a respectful manner and listened from feedback to improve upon the events making them more exciting and enjoyable.</p>
