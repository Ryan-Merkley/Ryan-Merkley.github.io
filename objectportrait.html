	   <p>This video was an individual project for my digital media course. This project was centered around visually storytelling an inanimate object without any spoken words or audio included. For this project, I decided to use a knife and a knife set as my objects to portray the idea of family and the feeling of being reunited. The reason why I chose these objects is because when you purchase a knife it comes together with a set of knives. This same goes with a family. A family is formed by a group of people that stick together and help each other.</p>
	   <p>During the filming process, I first searched around my house to see which areas would work best for the film as well as testing out potential camera angles. I found that storyboarding was very helpful at this stage because it allowed me to visualize how each scene would look. When filming my video, I took multiple camera shots of the same scene from different angles to see what it would look like from different perspectives. During the editing process, I used different editing techniques to help portray the narrative throughout the film. For example, I used the rack focus function to help display the meaning of importance between different objects. It helps direct the audience's eyes to each object and suggests a linking between the two of them. I also used dissolving effects to signify memories and flashbacks suggesting that the knife was remembering the past when it used to be with the other knives. The use of these techniques ultimately helped me convey the meaning being together and working together as a team.</p>
	   <p>Certain skills that I was able to demonstrate throughout this project were my research and planning skills. I found it helpful to watch videos online to see what other people had created to allow me to study different camera angles for my video. I also conducted research about techniques that could be used to effectively display emotion in a film. This helped in the filming process through the means of camera shots, and in the editing process through lighting effects. Planning also helped me determine days in advance what aspects of my project I wanted to get done. I set specific days for the research, filming and editing process. Planning helped me identify my goals and provided me with more control over each stage of the project.</p>
