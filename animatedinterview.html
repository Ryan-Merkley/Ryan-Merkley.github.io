    </div>
           <div id = "homeText">
		   <p>This animation was part of a final group project for my digital media course. This project revolved around the idea of visually storytelling a pre-recorded interview. When we were presented with this project, our team first decided to get as many recordings as we could by going around our campus and recording different individuals. This allowed us to obtain a variety of recordings all with different potential. We choose the recording of a woman's experience as a child with her brother because of the ability to incorporate a variety of different themes throughout the video as well as being able to have creative freedom with each scene. We then had a brainstorming session to determine what our characters and the environment in our animation would look like. This was important because we needed to make sure that there was going to be consistency among our designs. I was responsible for animating the scene when the hanger gets caught in the sister’s eye. I used Adobe After Effects to animate this scene and created all my design elements throughout this program. There were many challenges that I had to overcome when animating this scene. For example, when I first designed each character, I created them as a whole design, but then when I started animating, I found out that the entire body was moving. This required me to re-design my character as individual pieces allowing me to animate each limb separately to make them move. Upon completion of everybody’s sections, I finalized the animation by joining the scenes together and matching the audio with the lip-syncing scenes.</p>
		   <p>There were certain skills that I found I was able to effectively use throughout this project including my communication and leadership skills. Every week, I would make sure to contact each of my group members to check in with them to see how they were doing and if they needed any help. I would conduct weekly team meetings to allow everyone to show their progress and to determine whether our designs were following a consistent pattern. Finally, I regularly communicated with my group over Facebook and email, sending them pictures and short video clips of my designs to obtain feedback before going any further into the animation.</p>
