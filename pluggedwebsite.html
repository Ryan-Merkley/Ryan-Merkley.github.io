	   <p>Plugged is a prototype website that was a group project made for my digital imaging course. We were required to design a website that would help develop a brand for a business. For this project, we were assigned to a business called Plugged. Plugged is the intermediary between venues, artists, and audiences. They initiate communications between the involved parties, create a community with common interests and promote new music. Our main challenge when creating this website was being able to connect Plugged's three primary customer groups; the artist, the audience, and the venue. We wanted the pages for each customer group to be unique, while still maintaining connection with one another. An artist would be able to benefit from using Plugged as it would enable them to collaborate with other musicians and various venues. Audiences can discover new music, artists and new venues to visit, and venues can use Plugged to grow their business by seamlessly connecting with artists who are looking to perform.</p>
	   <p>For this project, I contributed to the design of the Discover page and the company logo. For my design of the logo, I first conducted research about our client’s main goals and used this information to design the logo. I wanted the logo to connect to their target market and therefore created it featuring their three customer groups. The logo is composed of a location pin for the venue, a record for the artist, and headphones for the audience. Once we had finished the designs for the logo, I then created a mock-up design of the Discover page to present to our client. When creating the final design, I incorporated a search menu on top of the mapping display to allow users to search for events and click on them to learn more about that venue.</p>
	   <p>A skill that I used effectively in this project was my leadership skills. Throughout the stages of our designs, I initiated meetings for both our team to discuss project ideas as well as with our client to broadcast our designs. I frequently communicated with our client through emails to keep them up to date with our work. I also made sure that everyone in our group had a part to work on for the project and regularly checked up on each member to make sure that they weren’t struggling and if they needed any assistance with their work.</p>
