	  <p>Fish Today is a prototype website and app designed for a school group project from my user experience course. This project was focused around developing a concept for a digital product, conducting research and user testing, and eventually create an interactive prototype. For this project we were given the concept of sports but, after some brainstorming we realized that most sports already had their own individual websites, expect for fishing. We decided to create a website solely around fishing that would allow a user to obtain all necessary information about fishing all within one application.</p>
	  <p>Once we had completed our brainstorming, we each designed our own versions of the website and application. I used a program called Balsamiq to create a mock-up for my designs to broadcast what each section would look like. Once we had completed all our designs, we decided to use pieces from everybody’s designs in our final project because each version had their own advantages. I was responsible for the design of the ‘Find Spots’ section of our app. I used Adobe Illustrator to design this section and incorporated the use of a map to show available finishing locations. While designing this section, I frequently used user testing to obtain feedback for my designs. I went to local fishing stores and had actual fishermen test this section. They were able to provide me with information regarding features the weren't necessary and features that I could improve upon to make more user friendly.</p>
	  <p>A skill that I believe allowed me to succeed in this project was my ability to accept and learn from criticism. I found that feedback from my designs was helpful in enhancing the quality of my work. It forced me to think about my designs in a way where everyone could benefit not just myself. For example, one of the usability testers said that they didn’t like the design of the mapping system because it would only benefit experienced fishermen who knew about popular fishing areas. I decided to add a recommendation feature to the map that showed the most frequent fishing spots. This therefore provided a way for not only experienced but amateur fishermen to enjoy the application as well.</p>
